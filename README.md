# CISCOU-1075 Introduction to Python for Network Engineers

"Learning to code can be intimidating. Lots of introductory material assumes a software development background, but this session will use examples relevant to network engineers and focus on the most practical and useful concepts for that audience when getting started with Python.
This session will teach things like:
·         Use Python to store inputs from a user and write it to a file
·         Loop over a list of interfaces and grab the IP Addresses
·         Extract data out of output such as getting the OS version from a “show version” "
